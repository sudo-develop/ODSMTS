ðŸš€ Introducing MediConnect â€“ A Step Towards Smarter Healthcare

Over the last few weeks, weâ€™ve been working on a project that aims to make a difference in the healthcare space â€” especially for those who rely on orphan drugs.
MediConnect is a web-based application that enables hospitals to track, manage, and share orphan drug inventory in real-time.

Here's how it works:

If a hospital urgently needs a rare/orphan drug, it can raise a request in MediConnect.
That request is visible to all hospitals on the platform.
Any hospital with surplus stock can voluntarily donate and fulfill that request.
Similarly, if a hospital has excess stock, it can initiate a donation offer, which can be claimed by others.

The idea is simple â€” to bridge the gap between need and availability using smart, real-time collaboration.

How it looks:
